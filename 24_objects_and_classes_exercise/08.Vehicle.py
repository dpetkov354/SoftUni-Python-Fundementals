# 8.* Vehicle
# Create a class Vehicle. The __init__ method should receive a type, a model, and a price. You should also set an owner to None. The class should have the following methods:
# buy(money: int, owner: str)
# oIf the person has enough money and the vehicle has no owner, returns: "Successfully bought a {type}. Change: {change}" and sets the owner to the given one
# oIf the money is not enough, return: "Sorry, not enough money"
# oIf the car already has an owner, return: "Car already sold"
# sell()
# oIf the car has an owner, set it to None again.
# oOtherwise, return: "Vehicle has no owner"
# __repr__()
# oIf the vehicle has an owner, returns: "{model} {type} is owned by: {owner}".
# oOtherwise, return: "{model} {type} is on sale: {price}"
#
# Test Code
# vehicle_type = "car"
# model = "BMW"
# price = 30000
# vehicle = Vehicle(vehicle_type, model, price)
# print(vehicle.buy(15000, "Peter"))
# print(vehicle.buy(35000, "George"))
# print(vehicle)
# vehicle.sell()
# print(vehicle)
#
# Output
# Sorry, not enough money
# Successfully bought a car. Change: 5000.00
# BMW car is owned by: George
# BMW car is on sale: 30000
